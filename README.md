# AnnotateContigs
Annotating de novo Generated Contigs

A bioinformatics focused script which does what it says on the box: annotates contigs. Given a BLAST XML file generated from aligning contigs to a set of reference genes utilizing NCBI's blast+ suite of command line scripts, this program stitches contigs together, effectively reconstructing the original DNA/RNA sequence.
